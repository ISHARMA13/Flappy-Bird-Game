# Flappy-Bird-Game

It is game where the bird falls down because of gravity. To make it fly up, you press space-bar. But, make sure it does not touch the top or bottom of the playing window. At the same time, you are required to cross between the pipes and move forward. If you hit the pipe, you lose. But you get 10 points for each pipe you cross safely. __How mcuh are you able to score??__
